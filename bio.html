                <p>Hi, I’m Clayton Wong a junior web developer based in Melbourne Australia. I’m is currently studying at Coder Academy, a web development and coding school  based in Australia. I like writing neat code that is easy to understand and also like creating pleasant to use interfaces</p>
                <p>My claim to fame is I served my country as an electronic technician in the Royal Australian Navy for almost ten years. The highlights of my military career include earning the dux for my class for one of my courses and repairing circuit boards while posted to one of the naval bases in Sydney.</p>
                <p>Before joining the military, I studied Digital Systems at Monash University and microelectronics at RMIT.</p>
                <p>When not studying, I can be found reading the news or walking around my neighbourhood.</p>
